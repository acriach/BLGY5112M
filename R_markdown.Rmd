## What is Quarto

Similar to the older R Markdown. Instead of exporting graphs and pasting into a Word document, R Markdown let you create a document - graph, text and all. This can make editing easier for you, less confusing if collaborating and better for reproducibility.

In summer 2022 Quarto was launched. This tutorial helps you make a Quarto document so that you have the choice to use Quarto in the future or understand how others use it.

## Open a Quarto file

In RStudio (version 2022.07.01 or later) go to the File menu > New File > Quarto Document. In the pop up give the Quarto file a Title such as "My Report". Select the radio button for Word (note you can select other outputs) and click Create.

Now save it by going to File > Save As. You could name it "My_Big_Important_Report"

You will see there is already template content in the Quarto file. Click Render at the top so you understand how Render reads the Quarto file and converts the code into a Word document.

This is a word file that is saved in your R project file. You can edit it by making changes in Quarto in RStudio and it will rewrite the word file. When it is finished you can use the file to upload, submit or print as normal.

## Make your own Quarto

Delete all template text in the Quarto file except the Yaml at the top.

The yaml tells R certain setting for the document such as what file format and ? Set up the yaml so it looks like the below.

Add a title

Add text

Add a plot,

Add an analysis

Add text that references the analysis.

Then render.

## Other formatting

Insert a page break after the title

Write super and subscript and mathermatial equations

Insert an image on content page

indent test

insert a link
